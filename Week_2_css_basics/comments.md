Here's where you can find my comments on you work as you progress...always look for the comments.md file :)

Good job with the "About Me" page, its a near-perfect clone. I only have a couple comments: 1) the "about me" and 'resume' link are off center, try finding a way to position them better (e.g. maybe make them a separate section you can style like in the column exercise we did in class), and 2) add a little spacing between your dividers used to separate links.

Looking forward to seeing what you do with the resume page. Make sure you include your work on this in a separate file.

Keep up the great work!
